- ## Visualizing Team Stats Based on EPA (Expected Points Added)


### Offensive EPA vs Defensive EPA

- ## What is EPA: Calculation:
- The EPA calculation provides a numerical value representing how much a play contributes to the team's scoring potential. A positive EPA indicates that the play had a positive impact on the team's scoring chances, while a negative EPA suggests a detrimental effect.

- Interpretation: A higher EPA value means that a play significantly improved the team's chances of scoring, while a lower (or negative) EPA value implies a decrease in scoring potential.
- The higher the EPA for Offense, the better.
- THe lower the EPA for Defense, the better.
